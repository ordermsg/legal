## Introduction
This document describes the legal relationship a user ("you", "the user", "individual") and Order ("us", "we", "our", "Service") (also known as "ordermsg"), have.

## Your responsibilities
#### Account usage
You agree that any actions done on behalf of your account are permitted by you, and that they are counted as being done by you personally.
#### Age
Order stores data that could be used to identify an individual, namely their E-Mail address and ID (a unique number given to each user). As such, you must be at least 13 years old (in most parts of the world, age may vary by country) in order to create an account.
#### E-Mail usage
You consent to us sending you short non-frequent E-Mail to your address for the following purposes:
- confirming your ownership of the address;
- informing you of any insecurities in the infrastructure that might have affected you;
- verifying your account.
#### Data exchange
You take full responsibility for you being charged by your Internet Service Provider as a result of data being sent between your device and our servers.
#### Illegal activities
You may not use our Service to participate in any activities deemed illegal in your current country of residence and/or the Republic of Finland, the Russian Federation and the European Union.
#### Harm to the Service
You may not use any systems, automatic or manual, created by you specifically or not, to cause harm to our infrastructure, including but not limited to:
- bypassing rate limits;
- bypassing Service access restrictions imposed as a result of Terms of Service violation;
- exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to any Service data;
- causing stability issues.

If you find a vulnerability, you promise to responsively disclose said vulnerability.
#### Emergency situations
Order may not be used for purposes where an error in communication can lead to harm to or destruction/death of property and/or individuals.
